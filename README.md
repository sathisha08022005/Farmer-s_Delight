IOT Based Smart Integrated Farming

The IoT-based Smart Integrated Farming project integrates poultry and fish farming, creating a synergistic ecosystem. It optimizes poultry conditions with temperature control and utilizes hen waste to nourish fish, providing nutrient-rich water for plant irrigation.

 The system includes Anider (Animal+Detector), a non-lethal device to protect crops from animals using machine learning . It doesnâ€™t hurt the animals, but scares the animal.
 
 Together, these projects exemplify a less area, more profit, less human intervention and sustainable approach to modern farming practices. 

 The IoT-based Smart Integrated Farming project follows a comprehensive methodology:
       1. Project Planning :  Define objectives, including IoT devices, raspberry pi, and sensors.
       2. System Design :  Create detailed architectures for integrated farming, multi-cropping                                               technique, azolla water-fern, Anider, mulching  and Solar Dryer systems.
        3. IoT Device Implementation : Set up - poultry temperature monitoring, sprinkler system, and soil moisture sensors for automated irrigation.
       4. Anider :  Implement thermal camera integration, servo motor, ultrasonic wave emitter, develop Raspberry Pi application with Regional-based Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN), random forest  machine learning and YOLO in deep learning.
